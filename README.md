# HogwartsLegacy-Internal
POC Internal Memory hack for the single player game Hogwarts Legacy
Based of Skengdo Cheat, I dumped the SDK and made a custom one.
Should be good to play arround with a bit, has the memory structures for the localplayer added.

Instructions:
If you want to hook ProcessEvent you have to compile minhook and link against it. Otherwise just don't use the hooking.
